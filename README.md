# Daily Code

Welcome to my **Daily Coding Practice** repository! Here, I document my journey of learning and improving my coding skills, primarily in **C++**.

## 📚 Purpose
The main goals of this repository are:
- To track my progress as I practice coding daily.
- To develop a strong foundation in C++ and other languages over time.
- To share my learning journey with others and possibly receive feedback or advice.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure
Each folder or file is named by **date** or **topic** for easy navigation.  
I will include small projects, coding exercises, and solutions to problems I’m working on.

## 🖥️ Technologies
Currently, I'm focusing on:
- **C++**: Developing a solid foundation in C++ programming.
- Other technologies may be added over time as I expand my learning.
