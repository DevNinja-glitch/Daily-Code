I had practised my loops, nested loops concepts in c++ and now of course I have also cleared my logic building of loops in javascript.
I came to know that it is really important in the further coding journey that's why I dedicated my day to it.
Now, Thanks to Allah Almighty i feel good while seeing patterns and I am confident in printing them using coding.
I am happy that I fing this note writing method so in this way I will not miss any date.
Best of luck to me in my Further Coding journey. IN SHA ALLAH !
